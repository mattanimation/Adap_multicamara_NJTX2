## Summary

In this Master's Thesis the * hardware * and * software * necessary for the correct adaptation of an * array * of cameras have been developed using the
NVIDIA Jetson TX2 development board. The electronic design of the different elements has been carried out as well as the structural design for the support
* array * mechanic and some parts for physical calibration. It has been done
the manufacture of the different elements, both mechanical and electronic, and
the * necessary * software has been developed both in the configuration of the * kernel * and
that of the * device tree * for the correct operation of the cameras. Finally, it has
proposed as an example of use the * software * calibration of the * array * of cameras
and an algorithm for estimating disparity maps.

## Abstract

In the present Master’s Degree Final Project the necessary hardware and software has been developed for the correct adaptation of an array of cameras using
the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 development board. The design has been carried out of the
different elements as well as the structural design for the the mechanical support
of the array and some parts for physical calibration. The fabrication of the different mechanical and electronic elements, and the necessary software has been
developed in the configuration of the kernel and the Device tree for the correct
operation of the cameras. Finally, the software calibration of the array of cameras and an algorithm for the estimation of disparity maps have been proposed.
